archivecraft
============

A tool to download all available versions of the Minecraft jars from Mojang. Have your own archive for maximum nostalgia in the years to come!


run `python archivecraft.py` to use

archivecraft uses the official Mojang version list and downloads

(Note: Some server versions are not available but the file is still created. These versions will give an invalid jarfile error when trying to execute them)
